                    Unnat Bharat Abhiyan is inspired by the vision of
                    transformational change in rural development processes by
                    leveraging knowledge institutions to help build the
                    architecture of an Inclusive India. Its mission is
                    conceptualized as a movement to enable processes that
                    connect institutes of higher education with local
                    communities to address the developmental challenges of rural
                    India through participatory processes and appropriate
                    technologies for accelerating sustainable growth. It also
                    aims to create a virtuous cycle between the society and an
                    inclusive university system by providing knowledge and
                    practices for emerging professions and to upgrade the
                    capabilities of both the public and the private sectors.

                    eco-friendly methods of farming like organic farming,
                    alternative energy sources like biogas in the villages. It
                    also promotes various govt. schemes in the above-mentioned
