                    The UBA team, formed in the month of August, 2017, conducted
                    a survey on August 13, 2017 to understand the village and
                    its people thoroughly with the help of the team members of
                    other villages. The survey was conducted on August 13, 2017,
                    with the student team visiting 120 different households in
                    the village. Efforts were made to reach every part of the
                    village and have as diverse a survey as possible, to negate
                    any bias towards any community or group of people.
                  </p>
                  <p align="justify">
                    The analysis of the survey threw up some very interesting
                    data:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All people had a roof on their heads and most of the
                    households had toilets, a rarity, as far as Indian villages
                    go. Many people were not aware of water conservation
                    techniques. Main source of Drinking water is Tube well. The
                    electricity connection is quite stable, with most of the
                    areas receiving electricity at least 20-21 hrs/day. The
                    nearest Hospital is in Bahadarabad. The nearest Bank is
                    Punjab National Bank in Puranpur. Most of the people have
                    Aadhar Card, Voter ID (if eligible), and Ration Card. ITC
                    has constructed toilets in the village through Corporate
                    social responsibility while many toilets under Nirmal
                    Bhaarat Abhiyaan (a scheme under which subsidy is given to
                    the people in construction of the toilets) are left
                    unconstructed. There are three self help groups in the
                    village. A self-help group (SHG) is a village-based
                    financial intermediary committee usually composed of 10â€“20
                    local women or men. A mixed group is generally not
                    preferred. Most self-help groups are located in India,
                    though SHGs can be found in other countries, especially in
                    South Asia and Southeast Asia.

                  <p>
                    While speaking with the villagers, the team also found some
                    common problems:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Water from most of the hand pumps in the village turns
                    yellow after 15 minutes. There is no Waste Disposal system
                    in the village and during rainy seasons there is an overflow
                    of water on roads. Main reason for the pollution of ground
                    water is dumping of waste near water sources. Drainage,
                    Drinking water and Street lights are the major problems in
                    the village.
