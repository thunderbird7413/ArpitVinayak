                    Chharba, inspite of being in Uttarakhand, is devoid of tough
                    and rocky terrains. It is in the foothills of the Himalayan
                    Terrains. Because of this, it is fairly accessible and can
                    be reached easily. Chharba is primarily divided into 3
                    parts, lower Chharba, middle Chharba, and upper Chharba.
                    This divide is a road branching out from NH72 passing
                    through Chharba. After Upper Chharba, the hilly terrains of
                    Uttarakhand take shape.

                    One of the prime ingredients for growth of a place is
                    present in Chharba. That factor is religious and cultural
                    diversity. Although the majority of people are Hindus, there
                    are about 40% Muslims and 3% Sikhs. But, the village lags
                    behind the state in gender ratio. The average sex ratio in
                    Uttarakhand is 963, while in Chharba it is just 918.
